# CapistranoFootball
As recompense for finishing in last place in my longstanding fantasy football league, I am awarded the opportunity to make a presentation to my friends explaining why I deserve to remain in the league. 

One of my arguments in support of remaining in the league is to explain that I was a victim of bad luck, and not poor team management. 
To demonstrate this, I have decided to use D3.js to visually chart each fantasy football team and their roster, in order to show which teams did indeed have the best players. 

*Hopefully next year goes much better...*
